the 🗂️ Backup & Restore seems to not backup if we are not in the page it self:
    need to do seperate app for 🗂️ Backup to run seperatly 


fix the hard coded->  run_automatic_backup_check(backup_interval_hours=0.1)
add a switch button to move between adgrid and streamlit df

# -move select option page into a new python file
# -slow process the gif is loading after few seconds and in some places is staying for long time until user click somthing .add thinking gif (same gif for all the waiting)  next to the clicked button until the operation is finished

-when navigating between pages it is tacking to long cause the page it fuly loading from the begining can you use cookies for faster optimisation that it wont be neded to fully load the pages when moving between them

-make pages independent so if page is not functioning just print error to the page

seperate the pages to difrent undependent web page for the restore and user mangment
# -when clicking on buttuon the web change color cause it is thinking or refreshing or doing rerun but the user can stil click on somthing else cause it is not changing the fu

remove reruns...
make ui look better by relocate buttons###
add an option that if admin deny user signup it can send also a message with a reson for why the user got denyied

# clean the code:
# "☑️ Select All Visible" remove from Equipment_Filters to some function
